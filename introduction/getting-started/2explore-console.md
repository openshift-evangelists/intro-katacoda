While the command line tool is awesome, for this course we are going to focus on the web console, which is equally awesome.

## Task 1
To begin, click on the **Dashboard** tab in the console frame of this browser window. This will open the web console link in another tab or window of your browser.

You should see an **OpenShift Origin** window with **Username** and **Password** forms as shown below:

![OpenShift Origin Web Console](../../assets/introduction/getting-started/ocp-login.png)

For this scenario, log in by entering the following:

**Username:** `developer`{{copy}}

**Password:** `developer`{{copy}}

After logging in to the web console, you'll see a blue button labeled *Create Project* in the top right corner of your screen that is shown below. Click this button to get started.

![Create Project Button](../../assets/introduction/getting-started/2create-project-button.png)

You should now see a page for creating your first project in web console. Fill in the _Name_ field as `myproject`{{copy}}.

![Create Project](../../assets/introduction/getting-started/2create-project.png)

The rest of the form is optional and up to you to fill in or ignore. Click *Create* to continue.

After your project is created, your project will appear under **My Projects** and you can click on `myproject` to access your newly created project.

## Task 2

Notice the menu on the left. You're now currently on the **Overview** screen. The tools that you'll need for building and deploying your application can also be found here on the left, as well as setting access controls.

Take a quick look around these, clicking on **Applications**, **Builds**, and **Resources** to see more options. There won't be much there for now as we have nothing in our project.

We'll get into those in future sections, but go ahead and explore to see what's possible! Don't spend too much time on that now as you will get to use a lot of those in the upcoming sections.
