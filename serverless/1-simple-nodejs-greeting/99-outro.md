## Congratulations

We have now learned how to:

* Write a simple JavaScript function
* Deploy the function to OpenShift Cloud Functions
* Invoke the function and see the results
* Find an Activation Id in the Activation log and get details on an Activation.

Please take sometime to play with other related scenarios that are available to get yourself familiarized with various
serverless concepts on OpenShift Cloud Functions. Good Luck!
