You can work with the templates using either the command line or the OpenShift web console. We will use the command line to deploy the template in this example.

If you still want to make use of the web console, click on the _Console_ tab in the workshop dashboard. You will be presented with the OpenShift login screen.

For the credentials, enter:

* **Username:** ``developer``{{copy}}
* **Password:** ``developer``{{copy}}

Once you have logged in, you should be shown the list of projects you have access to. A project called ``myproject`` has already been created for you to use in this workshop.

Click on ``myproject`` and you should then be at the _Overview_ page for
the project. You can then interact with the project and examine what happens as we work through the workshop.
