A fresh project named `debezium` is prepared with the necessary resources required to execute the deployment.
There are multiple resources created for you in the home directory, the project itself or configured in OpenShift
* a cloned [repository](https://github.com/strimzi/strimzi) of [Strimzi](http://strimzi.io) project
* Strimzi Cluster Controller managing Kafka brokers
* MySQL instance containing a small set of data to be streamed
* templates used to deploy components

**1. Run the following commands to switch to `debezium` project and explore it.**
> If you click on command it gets automatically copied it into the terminal and is executed

Switch to `debezium` project

``oc project debezium``{{execute}}

Check that MySQL instance is running

``oc get pods``{{execute}}

and that it is exposed as a service

``oc get svc``{{execute}}

The diagram of deployment now looks like

![Empty deployment](../../assets/middleware/debezium-getting-started/deployment-step-0.png)

**2. Deploy Kafka broker with ZooKeeper.**

The first component to deploy is a Kafka broker.

![Broker deployment](../../assets/middleware/debezium-getting-started/deployment-step-1.png)

This task is delegated to [templates](https://github.com/strimzi/strimzi/tree/0.2.0/examples/templates/cluster-controller) and Cluster Controller provided by [Strimzi](http://strimzi.io/) project.
The templates are already present in the home directory in the cloned repository.

The templates by default deploy Kafka broker and ZooKeeper in a high-available configuration with replication factor `3`.
This is not necessary in the development environment so we reduce the number of nodes and replication factor for system topics to `1`.

We also deploy an *ephemeral* variant of the broker.
You should use *persistent* variant in production.

To deploy the broker issue a command

``oc new-app strimzi-ephemeral -p ZOOKEEPER_NODE_COUNT=1 -p KAFKA_NODE_COUNT=1 -p KAFKA_OFFSETS_TOPIC_REPLICATION_FACTOR=1 -p KAFKA_TRANSACTION_STATE_LOG_REPLICATION_FACTOR=1
``{{execute}}

Now let's wait till both ZooKeeper and Kafka broker are deployed

``oc get pods -w``{{execute}}

The final list of pods should be similar to

    NAME                                           READY     STATUS    RESTARTS   AGE
    my-cluster-kafka-0                             1/1       Running   0          2m
    my-cluster-topic-controller-4124062197-l9lq4   1/1       Running   0          1m
    my-cluster-zookeeper-0                         1/1       Running   0          3m
    mysql-1-84j4w                                  1/1       Running   0          10m
    strimzi-cluster-controller-2044197322-cpmb9    1/1       Running   0          10m

> Note: Kafka depends on ZooKeeper so intermittent Kafka failures are expected as ZooKeeper might not be initialized at the time of Kafka start.

New services are available

``oc get svc -l app=strimzi-ephemeral``{{execute}}

    NAME                            CLUSTER-IP       EXTERNAL-IP   PORT(S)                      AGE
    my-cluster-kafka                172.30.243.180   <none>        9092/TCP,9091/TCP            1m
    my-cluster-kafka-headless       None             <none>        9092/TCP,9091/TCP            1m
    my-cluster-zookeeper            172.30.147.222   <none>        2181/TCP                     2m
    my-cluster-zookeeper-headless   None             <none>        2181/TCP,2888/TCP,3888/TCP   2m

**3. Verify the broker is up and running.**

> Note: The complete initialization of all components can take a couple of minutes. Please make sure that all pods are in *Running* state and are *Ready* before you try the next steps.

A successful attempt to send a message to (no output expected here)

``echo "Hello world" | oc exec -i my-cluster-kafka-0 -- /opt/kafka/bin/kafka-console-producer.sh --broker-list localhost:9092 --topic test``{{execute}}

and receive a message from

``oc exec my-cluster-kafka-0 -- /opt/kafka/bin/kafka-console-consumer.sh --bootstrap-server localhost:9092 --topic test --from-beginning --max-messages 1``{{execute}}

the deployed broker indicates that it is available.

## Congratulations

You have now successfully executed the first step in this scenario. 

You have successfully deployed Kafka broker service and made it available to clients to produce and consume messages.

In the next step of this scenario, we will deploy a single instance of Debezium.
