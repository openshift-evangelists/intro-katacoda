## What you will learn ##

In this scenario you will learn more about [RHDG](https://www.redhat.com/en/technologies/jboss-middleware/data-grid) Red Hat Data Grid (RHDG).

You will deploy and start a single instance of RHDG on OpenShift and subsequently invoke cache operations over REST.

## What is Red Hat Data Grid?

 Red Hat Data Grid (RHDG) is an open source in-memory data grid platform that offers multiple clustered modes, but its true value is observed while running in distributed mode where caches cluster together and expose a large memory heap.

An in-memory data grid is a distributed data management system for application data that:
* Uses memory (RAM) to store information for very fast, low-latency response time and very high throughput.
* Synchronizes data across multiple servers for continuous availability, reliability, and linear scalability.
* Can be used as distributed cache, NoSQL database, and event broker.

The technical advantages of in-memory data grid (IMDGs) provide business benefits in the form of faster decision-making, greater productivity, and improved customer engagement and experience.

In conclusion, RHDG offers your applications an improved performance and scalability while reducing access to expensive database management systems and transactional back ends.
